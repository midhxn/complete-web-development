## Web Development

Web development refers to the process of creating, designing, building, and maintaining websites. It involves various aspects such as web design, web content development, client-side scripting, server-side scripting, and network security configuration, among others.

Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and back-end development. Front-end development focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a website, including the user interface and user experience. It typically involves technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development focuses on the server-side of a website, including the database, server-side scripting, and APIs. It typically involves languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java.

## Web Development

Web development refers to the process of creating, designing, building, and maintaining websites. It involves various aspects such as web design, web content development, client-side scripting, server-side scripting, and network security configuration, among others.

Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and back-end development. Front-end development focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a website, including the user interface and user experience. It typically involves technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development focuses on the server-side of a website, including the database, server-side scripting, and APIs. It typically involves languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java.

There are several popular web development frameworks and platforms that developers use to build websites, such as WordPress, React, Angular, and Node.js. The choice of framework or platform largely depends on the project requirements and the developer's preference and expertise
